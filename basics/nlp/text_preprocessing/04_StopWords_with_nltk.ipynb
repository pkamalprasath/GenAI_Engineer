    "### Stop Words in NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "Stop words are very common words like the, is, in, on, and, to that appear in every sentence but add little meaning.In NLP, we often remove them because:\n",
    "They create noise and don’t help understand the main message.\n",
    "They reduce vocabulary size and make models faster.\n",
    "They improve accuracy for tasks like text classification, keyword extraction, and topic modeling.\n",
    "They help search engines focus on the important words.\n",
    "But stop words should not be removed when they influence meaning (e.g., not good, not bad) or in tasks like question answering.Overall, stop words are removed to make text cleaner, faster, and more meaningful for NLP models."
