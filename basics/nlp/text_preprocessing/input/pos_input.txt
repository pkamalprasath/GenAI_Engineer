paragraph="""In today's fast-moving world, people are constantly looking for better ways to stay healthy and productive. 
While many individuals try to follow a balanced diet, the reality is that most of them struggle to maintain consistency. 
The pressure of work, family responsibilities, and daily travel often makes it difficult to focus on proper nutrition. 
Because of this, a large number of people depend on quick snacks and ready-made meals, even though they know these foods are not always the best choices. 
To improve their lifestyle, some people have started exploring options like millet-based foods, natural sweeteners, and homemade snacks. 
These alternatives are becoming popular because they are easy to prepare, gentle on the stomach, and provide long-lasting energy. 
At the same time, technology plays an important role in how people make food decisions. 
The recommendations they see on their phones, the reviews they read online, and the advertisements they watch on social media all influence what they buy. 
With so much information available, learning how to clean text, remove stop words, and analyze data helps researchers understand people's real preferences more accurately.
